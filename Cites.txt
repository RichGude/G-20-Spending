Assumptions from choice of data sets:

- Primary students were chosen to represent all students vice combining multiple data sets to make
  a graph of all primary, secondary, and tertiary students.
- % of total spending of the country on healthcare only accounts for government spending on health-
  care, not private spending; this may affect perceptions of healthcare spending for non-socialized
  medicine.
- From the OECD Library, general government final consumption can be broken down into two distinct groups:
  The first reflects expenditures for collective consumption (defence, justice, etc.) which benefit society
  in large or whole parts, and are often known as public goods and services. The second relates to
  expenditures for individual consumption (health care, housing, education, etc.), that reflect expenditures incurred by government
  on behalf of an individual household.  General govenment final consumption will be used as a proxy then
  for government expenses related to education, healthcare, and military.
