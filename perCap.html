                <b>The data was downloaded as World-Bank-formatted comma-separated-value (csv) files</b>; specifically, this means that the files contained
                additional line breaks and unnecessary columns and data for the analysis herein.
                
                The World Bank files contain information from countries and economic/political unions (e.g., the "Arab World" referring to the members
                of the League of Arab States, as establised in the metadata commentary) from as far back as 1960 to the present (~2020).  Unfortuneately, for
                many countries, years of data may be missing from various data sets.  If enough years of data are missing, the analysis of each country
                is essentially meaningless, and analysis of such countries is not warranted nor recommended.  For countries that have only a few years of missing
                data, data can be linearly <em>interpolated</em> (though not <em>extrapolated</em>, meaning that data from before or after the first or last known data, respectively,
                will not be computed).
                <br><br>
                
                Accordingly, each file was prepared in such a way as to only display dollar, for the case of GDP information, or percent, for the case of spending information, values for each country
                and year catalogged by the World Bank organization, and saved to a Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets-style format.
                <br><br>

                <b>Assumptions:</b><br> The World Bank repository contained educational expenditure information for primary (elementary-age), secondary (high-school-age),
                and tertiary (college-age) students.  <b>Primary students were chosen to represent all students</b> vice combining multiple data sets to make
                an average graph of all primary, secondary, and tertiary students. <br><br>
                
                
                No military spending per capita datasets were available from the World Bank data repository.  For this reason, data prepping included calculating the 
                per capita military spending by taking the data from military expenditure as a percent of GDP, multiplying by the GDP, and then dividing by the total 
                population of the country under analysis.<br><br>

                As will be seen below, these assumptions may not have been proper: <br>

            <h5>Comparing Per Capita Educational Spending Levels Between Countries</h5>
            <p>Based upon the exceptional high values of educational spending being recorded within the data and shown in the visual above, in some cases over 
            $100,000 US dollars per person, there is <em>likely some issue with the data generation</em> efforts used to produce the educational spending data. 
            identified within the <b>"Assumptions"</b> above, the primary students were chosen to represent all students and, perhaps more importantly for the 
            issues documented herein, the value was recorded in <em>percent of GDP per capita</em>.  During Data Preparation, it was believed by the author that 
            this meant multiplying that percent value by the total GDP and dividing by the total population would have the desired effect of producing an adequate 
            per capita spending value; however, that appears to have not worked. <br><br>
            
            Regardless of the true dollar values, the trends in spending should still be identifiable, namely: it can be seen for any given year that European and 
            other late-stage-economy countries such as Japan and Autralia have much have per capita spending on education than many Asian and Latin American countries. 
            This would identify either a causal or precipitous reason for the state of the advanced economies; that is to say, stronger, larger econmies tend to 
            invest more money per person in education which either causes their economies to be advanced or is caused by their economies being advanced.  It stands 
            to common rational thought that the former is likely since investment in the education of the population allows for innovation and advanced skill sets 
            which tend to lead to better economic output. <br><br></p>

              <h5>Comparing Per Capita Healthcare Spending Levels Between Countries</h5>
              <p>Compared to the per capita dollar values from the educational data, the healthcare data seems much more reasonable in value, with a maximum per capita 
                value of ~$10,000.  This is because the World Bank resources directly recorded and distributed per capita healthcare values (vice those values having to 
                be calculated by the author). <br><br>
                
                The trends in spending follow the model set by educational spending, namely: it can be seen for any given year that European and 
                other late-stage-economy countries such as Japan and Autralia have much have per capita spending on healthcare than many Asian and Latin American countries. 
                This would identify either a causal or precipitous reason for the state of the advanced economies; that is to say, stronger, larger econmies tend to 
                invest more money per person in healthcare which either causes their economies to be advanced or is caused by their economies being advanced.  It stands 
                to common rational thought that the former is likely since investment in health allow workers to stay more productive for longer, feeding back into the 
                economy when they otherwise would have not been able to without appropriate healthcare. <br><br></p>

              <h5>Comparing Per Capita Educational Spending Levels Between Countries</h5>
              <p>Based upon the exceptional high values of military spending being recorded within the data and shown in the visual above, in some cases over 
              $200,000 US dollars per person, there is <em>likely some issue with the data generation</em> efforts used to produce the military spending data. 
              identified within the <b>"Assumptions"</b> above, no military spending per capita datasets were available from the World Bank data repository.  During Data Preparation,
              this meant multiplying that military spending as a percent value of GDP by the total GDP and dividing by the total population would have the desired effect of producing an adequate 
              per capita military spending value; however, that appears to have not worked. <br><br>
              
              Regardless of the true dollar values, the trends in spending should still be identifiable, namely: there are many countries who invest very little in military 
              spending compared to the proportion of countries who invest more highly in healthcare or education.  These high-investing countries are presumably US and European/Mid-East 
              actors that support or take an antagonistic approach to US military interests. <br><br>
              
              In addition, there is a marked increase in the amount of military spending 
              after the beginning of the millenium that tapers off around 2008 and begins to pick up after.  This makes sense with respect to the geopolitical events taking 
              place around these times.  Prior to 2001, the major powers of the world were scaling back military spending after the Cold War, but this trend reversed with the 
              US September 11th attacks and the new Global War on Terror policies of the US and her allies.  Then in 2008, a large global recession markedly affects the 
              resources that countries have to spare in, presumably, non-essential military actions. <br><br></p>
